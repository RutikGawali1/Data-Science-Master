        "- Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used in machine learning to encode categorical variables based on the mean of the target variable (response variable) for each category. This encoding method is particularly useful when dealing with ordinal categorical variables where the order of categories matters. The idea is to capture the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable, and encode the categories in a way that reflects their impact on the target.\n",

        "Order the categories based on their mean target values in ascending or descending order. The idea is to assign a higher encoded value to categories that have a higher mean target value, indicating a stronger positive correlation with the target variable.\n",

        "Covariance is a statistical measure that quantifies the degree to which two variables change together. In other words, it indicates the direction of the linear relationship between two variables.
