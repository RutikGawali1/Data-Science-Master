        "\n",
        "R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure in linear regression that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It indicates how well the regression model fits the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Calculation of R-squared\n",
        "R-squared is calculated using the following formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "R^2 = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- SS_res is the sum of squares of residuals, calculated as:\n",
        "  SS_res = Σ(y_i - ŷ_i)^2\n",
        "  Here, y_i is the actual value, and ŷ_i is the predicted value from the regression model.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- SS_tot is the total sum of squares, calculated as:\n",
        "  SS_tot = Σ(y_i - ȳ)^2\n",
        "  Here, ȳ is the mean of the actual values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpretation of R-squared\n",
        "- 0 ≤ R-squared ≤ 1: R-squared values range from 0 to 1.\n",
        "  - An R-squared of 0 means that the independent variables do not explain any of the variance in the dependent variable.\n",
        "  - An R-squared of 1 means that the independent variables explain all the variance in the dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Higher R-squared values indicate a better fit of the model to the data, meaning that a higher proportion of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Considerations\n",
        "- Overfitting: A very high R-squared value may indicate overfitting, especially in models with many predictors relative to the number of observations. Overfitting occurs when the model captures the noise in the data rather than the underlying relationship.\n",
        "- Adjusted R-squared: To account for the number of predictors in the model, especially when comparing models with a different number of predictors, the adjusted R-squared is often used. It adjusts the R-squared value based on the number of predictors and the sample size, providing a more accurate measure of model fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Limitations\n",
        "- Non-linear relationships: R-squared only measures the fit of linear models. It may be misleading in the presence of non-linear relationships between the dependent and independent variables.\n",
        "- Additional predictors: Adding more predictors to a model will always increase or maintain the R-squared value, even if the new predictors are not significant. This is why adjusted R-squared is preferred in such cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, R-squared is a valuable metric for assessing the goodness-of-fit in linear regression models, but it should be used with an understanding of its limitations and in conjunction with other metrics and diagnostics.\n"
